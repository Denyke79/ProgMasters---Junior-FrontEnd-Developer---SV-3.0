# ProgMasters---Junior-FrontEnd-Developer---SV-3.0

In the last 5 months I have been attending the [ProgMasters](https://progmasters.hu/) Junior FrontEnd Developer training, in this repo I would like to share some of the code I have written here.

During the training I first learned the basics of HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, wrote code using Bootstrap, and then in the second half of the course I learned about FireBase, TypeScript and especially the Angular framework.

During the bootcamp I had the opportunity to work on 2 independent project assignments with 3 of my fellow students. The first project was to create a static responsive website based on a sample image. The second project was a free choice single page application in Angular framework using Bootstrap. These and my exam works are included in this repo.

## Single Page BikeShop Website

The status shown in the demo branch shows 55-60% of the planned site, but unfortunately we got there in less than 2 weeks of development.

Vivien Gábor, Roland Lengyel and Dávid Báskay worked with me on the project, but due to lack of time I developed almost the whole project.
The off-canvas part of the site was done in pair programming, as well as the custom directive on the main page and the pagination. I was responsible for the other features, these are the ones:
- catalogue and associated filters
- add, remove, edit new products on the admin page
- admin page to add, remove and edit new service orders
- add firebase authentication, add routing and guards

We plan to continue the project with Dávid Báskay in the future, where we would mainly aim for a more unified look and feel, common paginator and filters, and implement firebase queries from frontend to backend. In addition, a mobile responsive view would be a focus, as well as smaller animations using angular material.

## Static Travel Blog

The task was to create a static page based on sample images. These images can be found in the assets\sample folder.

Vivien Gábor, Roland Lengyel and Dávid Báskay worked with me on the project. For the project we used a Trello board, and for the expected look and feel we also used the help of Figma.

I was mainly responsible for writing the navigation menu and the messaging section at the bottom of the page. I also worked on the carousel section for a longer time with the help of pair programming.
